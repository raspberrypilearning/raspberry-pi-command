## Uitdaging: maak een nieuw commando

Command scripts are really useful for tasks that you do regularly where you have to remember the details such as command line arguments or multiple commands in order.

\--- task ---

Create a new command that's useful to you.

\--- /task ---

If you can't think of anything, here are some ideas of scripts:

- `hostname -I` â€” this will show the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, which is useful if you want to connect to it remotely
- `cat /proc/device-tree/model` displays information about your Raspberry Pi (the `cat` command displays the contents of a file); use formatting to display the result and create a command that you can run from a menu
- Create a Stroop effect test where you write colours in different-coloured text and have to try to say the name of the colour that you see, rather than the word
- Create a custom version of the `scrot` command that uses your favourite options, for example, taking a screenshot of a particular window and creating a thumbnail
- Create simple pixel art by changing the background colour and printing space characters
