## Challenge: Create a new command

Can you create a new command that's useful for you.

Command scripts are really useful for tasks you do regularly where you have to remember the details such as command line arguments or multiple commands in order.

You can create an icon image with a image editor you are familiar with. 

Tip: You can export costumes from the paint editor in Scratch and use those. 


Here are some ideas of scripts you can't think of anything:

- `hostname -I` - this will show the ip address of your Raspberry Pi, this is useful if you want to connect to it remotely. 
- `cal` displays a calendar for the current month with today highlighted, use `man cal` on the command line to see options you can use
- `cat /proc/device-tree/model` displays information about your Raspberry Pi (the cat command displays the contents of a file), use formatting to display the result and create a command you can run from a menu
- create a Stroop effect test where you write colours in different coloured text and have to try and say the name of the colour you see rather than the word. 
- Create a custom version of the scrot command that uses your favourite options, for example taking a screenshot of a particular window and creating a thumbnail.
- Create simple pixel art by changing the background colour and printing space characters.
