## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi runs the Raspberry Pi OS operating system which makes use of the Bash scripting language. When you type commands into a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi, you are typing Bash commands. You can put multiple commands into a file to create a Bash script which creates a new command that can be typed in a terminal window or run from the Main Menu on the Raspberry Pi. 

In this project you will learn some Bash commands and create your own command to display a message in coloured text and use other colour effects. 


### What you will make

--- no-print ---
